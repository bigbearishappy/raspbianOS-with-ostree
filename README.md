Thank a lot for [jallwine](https://github.com/jallwine) and [starnight](https://github.com/starnight)

This repo is based on [bbb-ostree-helper-scripts](https://github.com/PocketNC/bbb-ostree-helper-scripts) which is maintained by jallwine.
He helps me a lot when I am in trouble with usage of bbb-ostree-helper-scripts. :)

The basic idea of adapting raspbian os with ostree is from starnight's [discussion](https://github.com/ostreedev/ostree/issues/2223#issuecomment-718417071) in the issue of ostree.
